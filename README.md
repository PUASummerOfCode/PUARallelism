# PUARallelism
PUA distributed systems and parallel programming tutorials and code


-Table of Contents Here

	1. Initial Features List
		0-Start some parallel programming course/develop a tutorial somehow
		0-Install Main methods: OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, Hadoop
		0-Implement simple known parallel algorithms
		-Perform interesting big data analysis (choose one heavy db to try on)
		-Apply an advanced algorithm for facial detection that is CPU intensive on a cluster (hired or made up of laptops of lab computers)
		-Apply a heavy AI algorithm for voice/speech/NLP recognition/processing
		Some Interesting links:
